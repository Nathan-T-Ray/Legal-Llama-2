# Legal-Llama-2

Co-developed with Colgate Alumni Danny Liu, project can be found at this repository:

https://github.com/dliuu/Legal_Llama2

Code to fine tune the 7B parameter Llama 2 (used with permission from Meta) on New York Law: Sections Real Property, Real Property Actions and Proceedings, Real Property Tax. 

Unfortunately we did not possess the storage capacity necessary to house the fine-tuned model, coming in at over 30 gigabytes, however the training runs successfully in cloud computing and thus should be possible.
